## 📄 Automating Receipt Processing using AWS Services

Managing receipts manually is often time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. This project focuses on automating receipt processing using **AWS cloud-native services** to extract, store, and notify users with minimal manual intervention.

Instead of manually handling receipts, this system extracts **structured data** from receipt images and PDFs, then stores it efficiently for **record-keeping and auditing**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project is broken down into modular layers, each powered by a specific AWS service:

### 📦 Storage Layer
- **Amazon S3**  
  Stores uploaded receipt images and PDFs securely.

### 🧾 Processing Layer
- **Amazon Textract**  
  Extracts text and structured data using **AI-powered OCR**.

### 🗃️ Database Layer
- **Amazon DynamoDB**  
  Stores the extracted data in a scalable NoSQL database.

### 📧 Notification Layer
- **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**  
  Sends email alerts with receipt details to users or admins.

### ⚙️ Compute Layer
- **AWS Lambda**  
  Automates the receipt processing workflow on new uploads (serverless).
